title: Transport Layer
description: Compare TCP and UDP delivery behavior using reliability vs speed tradeoffs.
order: 2
estimatedMinutes: 35
objectives:
  - Compare TCP and UDP based on confirmation, ordering, and speed.
  - Explain why some apps choose reliable delivery and others choose faster delivery.
  - Describe acknowledgments and retransmission in transport workflows.
tryIts:
  - title: Choose a transport mode
    prompt: Pick TCP or UDP for each case and justify the choice.
    starterCode: |
      1) Sending a bank transaction: __________
      2) Live game position updates: __________
      3) Downloading a homework PDF: __________
    expectedOutput: |
      Example:
      1) TCP (must arrive correctly)
      2) UDP (speed is higher priority)
      3) TCP (complete ordered delivery)
    tags:
      - tcp
      - udp
breakIts:
  - title: Out-of-order packet confusion
    prompt: Explain why this flow can fail if data arrives in random order.
    starterCode: |
      packets = ["part3", "part1", "part2"]
      full_message = "".join(packets)
      print(full_message)
    expectedOutput: |
      Without ordering logic, the reassembled message is wrong. TCP sequencing fixes this.
    hints:
      - Order matters for files and long messages.
      - Delivery guarantees differ between TCP and UDP.
fixIts:
  - title: Add acknowledgment logic
    prompt: Repair the pseudocode so the sender retries missing packet 2.
    starterCode: |
      sent = [1, 2, 3]
      acked = [1, 3]
      print("Delivered:", sent)
    solutionCode: |
      sent = [1, 2, 3]
      acked = [1, 3]
      missing = [packet for packet in sent if packet not in acked]
      print("Resend:", missing)
    expectedOutput: |
      Resend: [2]
checks:
  - label: TCP definition check
    type: concept
    criteria: Explain why TCP is often compared to registered mail.
  - label: UDP definition check
    type: concept
    criteria: Describe one situation where UDP is preferred despite possible loss.
  - label: ACK behavior check
    type: output
    criteria: State what happens in TCP when an expected acknowledgment does not arrive.

# Transport Layer

The transport layer decides how data chunks move between endpoints: carefully confirmed or quickly sent.

<InternetLayerVisual layer="transport" analogyLabel="Registered mail lane vs postcard lane." />

## Real-World Analogy

Think of two delivery lanes:

- `TCP` is registered mail: numbered parcels, receipts, and resend when one is missing.
- `UDP` is postcards: fast to send, but no guarantee every card arrives.

## Components In This Layer (From the PDF Definitions)

- `TCP`: Connection-oriented delivery with ordering, reliability, and acknowledgments.
- `UDP`: Connectionless delivery with low overhead and no delivery confirmation.

## What The Loop Visual Shows

The top conveyor lane is TCP with ACK and resend indicators. The lower lane is UDP, where packets burst quickly with no confirmation stage.
