title: Physical Layer
description: Explore how bits travel through fiber, copper, and wireless media.
order: 5
estimatedMinutes: 35
objectives:
  - "Identify the three physical media in this course: fiber, copper, and wireless."
  - Explain that the same bits can travel over different physical signals.
  - Compare how medium choice affects speed, distance, and interference risk.
tryIts:
  - title: Match medium to signal style
    prompt: Pair each medium with the signal form that carries bits.
    starterCode: |
      Fiber -> ____________________
      Copper -> ____________________
      Wireless -> ____________________
    expectedOutput: |
      Fiber -> light pulses
      Copper -> electrical changes
      Wireless -> radio waves
    tags:
      - fiber
      - copper
      - wireless
breakIts:
  - title: Treat all media as identical
    prompt: Explain why this assumption causes design mistakes.
    starterCode: |
      medium = ["fiber", "copper", "wireless"]
      for m in medium:
          print(m, "supports exactly the same distance and noise profile")
    expectedOutput: |
      Media differ in distance, interference, and capacity; network designs must account for those differences.
    hints:
      - Wireless is flexible but sensitive to environment.
      - Fiber often supports high capacity over long distance.
fixIts:
  - title: Choose medium by context
    prompt: Update the mapping so each location uses a practical medium.
    starterCode: |
      location = {"backbone": "copper", "desk": "wireless", "hallway_ap": "fiber"}
      print(location)
    solutionCode: |
      location = {"backbone": "fiber", "desk": "copper", "hallway_ap": "wireless"}
      print(location)
    expectedOutput: |
      {'backbone': 'fiber', 'desk': 'copper', 'hallway_ap': 'wireless'}

# Physical Layer

The physical layer is the actual path where raw bit signals travel through material media.

<InternetLayerVisual layer="physical" analogyLabel="Roads, tunnels, and air lanes carrying the same cargo bits." />

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine one cargo type moving through three channels:

- Road lanes
- Tunnel lanes
- Air lanes

The package is the same, but the travel method changes by channel.

## Components In This Layer (From the PDF Definitions)

- `Fiber`: Bit signals carried as light pulses.
- `Copper`: Bit signals carried as electrical changes.
- `Wireless`: Bit signals carried as radio wave patterns.

## What The Loop Visual Shows

Three synchronized lanes animate signal pulses, showing how one bit stream can be represented as light, electrical pulses, or radio transmissions.
