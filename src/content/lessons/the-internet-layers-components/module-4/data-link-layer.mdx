description: Learn how frames support local network delivery between nearby devices.
order: 4
estimatedMinutes: 35
objectives:
  - Define a frame as a local delivery unit on a link.
  - Explain how local switching chooses the right nearby destination.
  - Distinguish local frame delivery from end-to-end internet routing.
tryIts:
  - title: Match frame to local destination
    prompt: Decide which local unit receives each frame label.
    starterCode: |
      Frame 1 -> Unit B
      Frame 2 -> Unit A
      Frame 3 -> Unit C
      Explain how the switch decides: ____________________
    expectedOutput: |
      The switch reads local destination labels and forwards each frame to the matching local port.
    tags:
      - frames
      - local-network
breakIts:
  - title: Broadcast every frame everywhere
    prompt: Identify the problem with sending every frame to all units.
    starterCode: |
      local_units = ["A", "B", "C"]
      frame_target = "B"
      for unit in local_units:
          print("Send frame to", unit)
    expectedOutput: |
      This creates unnecessary traffic and privacy risk. Local switching should send only to the correct destination.
    hints:
      - Local delivery should be targeted.
      - Flooding is noisy and inefficient for normal traffic.
fixIts:
  - title: Forward only to correct local port
    prompt: Repair the logic to send the frame to one destination.
    starterCode: |
      local_units = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}
      frame_target = "B"
      for unit in local_units:
          print("Send frame to port", local_units[unit])
    solutionCode: |
      local_units = {"A": 1, "B": 2, "C": 3}
      frame_target = "B"
      print("Send frame to port", local_units[frame_target])
    expectedOutput: |
      Send frame to port 2
checks:
  - label: Frame definition check
    type: concept
    criteria: Explain what a frame is and where it is used.
  - label: Local scope check
    type: concept
    criteria: Describe why data-link behavior is local instead of internet-wide.
  - label: Switch behavior check
    type: output
    criteria: State what a switch should do when it knows the destination is on one specific port.

# Data Link Layer

The data link layer handles local delivery on one network segment using frames and switching behavior.

<InternetLayerVisual layer="data-link" analogyLabel="Apartment mailroom sorting framed packages to local units." />

## Real-World Analogy

Imagine an apartment mailroom. Each package has a local unit label, and the mailroom clerk routes it to the right mailbox in the same building.

## Components In This Layer (From the PDF Definitions)

- `Frames`: Structured local-delivery units that carry data and local addressing details for one network link.

## What The Loop Visual Shows

Frame cards travel through a switch-like hub and then branch to specific local devices, repeating the local sorting cycle.
