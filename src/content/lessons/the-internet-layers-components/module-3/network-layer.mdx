description: Learn how IP forwards packets hop by hop across different networks.
order: 3
estimatedMinutes: 35
objectives:
  - Explain IP addressing as a routing destination label.
  - Describe hop-by-hop forwarding across routers.
  - Explain how rerouting can still reach the same destination.
tryIts:
  - title: Plan a packet route
    prompt: Write a possible hop sequence from school laptop to remote server.
    starterCode: |
      Source: school laptop
      Hop 1: ____________________
      Hop 2: ____________________
      Hop 3: ____________________
      Destination: cloud server
    expectedOutput: |
      Example:
      Hop 1: school router
      Hop 2: city ISP router
      Hop 3: regional backbone router
    tags:
      - ip
      - routing
breakIts:
  - title: Wrong destination address
    prompt: Explain what happens when a packet has the wrong destination IP.
    starterCode: |
      packet = {"dest_ip": "203.0.113.99", "data": "request"}
      print("Forwarding to", packet["dest_ip"])
    expectedOutput: |
      Routers forward to the wrong endpoint path, so the intended host never receives the packet.
    hints:
      - Routers use destination IP fields.
      - Forwarding decisions are address based, not app-name based.
fixIts:
  - title: Repair hop decision
    prompt: Route packets to next hop by destination prefix.
    starterCode: |
      routes = {"10.": "Router-A", "172.": "Router-B"}
      dest = "192.168.1.4"
      next_hop = routes.get(dest[:3], "DROP")
      print(next_hop)
    solutionCode: |
      routes = {"10.": "Router-A", "172.": "Router-B", "192.": "Router-C"}
      dest = "192.168.1.4"
      next_hop = routes.get(dest[:4], "DROP")
      print(next_hop)
    expectedOutput: |
      Router-C
checks:
  - label: IP label check
    type: concept
    criteria: Explain what piece of information routers inspect to choose the next hop.
  - label: Hop flow check
    type: output
    criteria: Describe what the term hop means in packet forwarding.
  - label: Reroute check
    type: concept
    criteria: Explain how packets can still arrive when one route path is congested or unavailable.

# Network Layer

The network layer moves packets between networks, deciding where each packet goes next on its trip.

<InternetLayerVisual layer="network" analogyLabel="Postal routing across cities by destination address." />

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a postal system across many cities. Workers read destination addresses and pass each package to the next center until it reaches the target city.

## Components In This Layer (From the PDF Definitions)

- `IP`: Provides addressing and forwarding rules so routers can send packets hop by hop across interconnected networks.

## What The Loop Visual Shows

The node graph represents routers. A highlighted packet marker moves from node to node while the graph rotates, showing continuous forwarding and possible reroutes.
