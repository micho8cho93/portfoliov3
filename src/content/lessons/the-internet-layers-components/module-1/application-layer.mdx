moduleId: "01"
moduleTitle: Module 1 · Application Layer
title: Application Layer
description: Understand how DNS, HTTP, and TLS handle human-friendly web requests.
order: 1
estimatedMinutes: 35
objectives:
  - Explain how DNS maps names to numeric addresses.
  - Describe HTTP request and response behavior in plain language.
  - Explain how TLS adds privacy and integrity to app traffic.
tryIts:
  - title: Map a web visit flow
    prompt: Write the request path from browser to server in three short steps.
    starterCode: |
      1) Name lookup: ____________________
      2) Request rule set: ____________________
      3) Privacy layer: ____________________
    expectedOutput: |
      Example:
      1) DNS maps learnsite.org to an IP.
      2) HTTP sends GET /home and receives a response.
      3) TLS encrypts the data in transit.
    tags:
      - dns
      - http
      - tls
breakIts:
  - title: Missing DNS lookup
    prompt: The browser sends HTTP to a website name without converting the name first. Explain the failure.
    starterCode: |
      browser_address = "schoolportal.edu"
      transport_destination = browser_address
      print("Sending HTTP request to", transport_destination)
    expectedOutput: |
      The destination must be an IP address first, so DNS is required before HTTP delivery.
    hints:
      - Routers forward by numeric addressing.
      - Domain names are for people, not forwarding tables.
fixIts:
  - title: Add TLS to a plain request
    prompt: Update the flow so the request is encrypted before transit.
    starterCode: |
      destination = "198.51.100.24"
      protocol = "HTTP"
      print(protocol, "request to", destination)
    solutionCode: |
      destination = "198.51.100.24"
      protocol = "HTTPS (HTTP + TLS)"
      print(protocol, "request to", destination)
    expectedOutput: |
      HTTPS (HTTP + TLS) request to 198.51.100.24

# Application Layer

The application layer is where user-facing rules live: naming, requesting, and protecting content.

<InternetLayerVisual layer="application" analogyLabel="Restaurant front desk: names, menu orders, and sealed envelopes." />

## Real-World Analogy

Think of a restaurant front desk:

- `DNS` is the host stand translating a restaurant name into a street number.
- `HTTP` is how you place and receive your order.
- `TLS` is a sealed envelope so others cannot read your order on the way.

## Components In This Layer (From the PDF Definitions)

- `DNS`: Converts readable names into numeric destination addresses.
- `HTTP`: Defines request and response message format for web resources.
- `TLS`: Adds encryption and integrity checks to protect application data.

## What The Loop Visual Shows

The cards represent browser and server. Packets move in both directions for request and response, DNS flips from name to number, and the lock pulse represents TLS protection.
