moduleTitle: Conditionals
title: Conditionals
description: Make decisions in Python with boolean expressions, if/elif/else, and comparison operators.
order: 2
estimatedMinutes: 50
objectives:
  - Evaluate boolean expressions with comparison operators.
  - Choose between `if`, `elif`, and `else` branches.
  - Write decision logic that is readable and testable.
tryIts:
  - title: Letter grade branch
    prompt: Print a letter grade based on a numeric score.
    starterCode: |
      score = 84

      if score >= 90:
          print("A")
      elif score >= 80:
          print("B")
      else:
          print("Needs improvement")
    expectedOutput: |
      B
    tags:
      - if-elif-else

breakIts:
  - title: Incorrect comparison type
    prompt: Run this and identify why comparison logic fails for some inputs.
    starterCode: |
      age = input("Age: ")

      if age >= 18:
          print("Adult")
      else:
          print("Minor")
    expectedOutput: |
      TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'
    tags:
      - debugging
      - type-conversion

fixIts:
  - title: Fix pass/fail checker
    prompt: Repair the condition so scores of 70 and above pass.
    starterCode: |
      score = 70

      if score > 70:
          print("Pass")
      else:
          print("Fail")
    solutionCode: |
      score = 70

      if score >= 70:
          print("Pass")
      else:
          print("Fail")
    expectedOutput: |
      Pass
    hints:
      - Check the boundary condition for exactly 70.
    tags:
      - boundary-cases

checks:
  - label: Concept check
    type: concept
    criteria: Explain when to use `elif` instead of nesting many `if` statements.
  - label: Output check
    type: output
    criteria: "Predict output when `temp = 72` in `if temp > 75: print(\"Hot\") else: print(\"Not hot\")`."

This lesson introduces branch logic.

<SlideDeck src="/resources/intro-to-python/2_Conditionals.pptx" title="Conditionals slide deck" />

Start with one decision, test both true and false cases, then expand to multiple branches.
