moduleTitle: Lists
title: Lists
description: Store and process collections with list operations and iteration.
order: 6
estimatedMinutes: 55
objectives:
  - Create and update Python lists.
  - Iterate through list items with loops.
  - Use list methods for adding, removing, and measuring items.
tryIts:
  - title: Add and print list items
    prompt: Build a list of tasks and print each task.
    starterCode: |
      tasks = ["study", "practice", "review"]
      tasks.append("quiz")

      for task in tasks:
          print(task)
    expectedOutput: |
      study
      practice
      review
      quiz
    tags:
      - lists
      - loops

breakIts:
  - title: Wrong list index
    prompt: Run this and identify why item assignment fails.
    starterCode: |
      scores = [85, 90, 78]
      scores[3] = 92
      print(scores)
    expectedOutput: |
      IndexError: list assignment index out of range
    tags:
      - indexing

fixIts:
  - title: Fix average calculation
    prompt: Repair the code so it computes the average score.
    starterCode: |
      scores = [80, 90, 100]
      average = sum(scores)
      print("Average:", average)
    solutionCode: |
      scores = [80, 90, 100]
      average = sum(scores) / len(scores)
      print("Average:", average)
    expectedOutput: |
      Average: 90.0
    hints:
      - Use both `sum()` and `len()`.
    tags:
      - aggregation

checks:
  - label: Output check
    type: output
    criteria: Predict output of `items = [1,2]; items.append(3); print(len(items))`.
  - label: Code check
    type: code
    criteria: Write a loop that prints each name from `names = ["Ana", "Bo", "Chi"]`.

Lists are the bridge to capstone work because they let students manage multi-item data sets.
