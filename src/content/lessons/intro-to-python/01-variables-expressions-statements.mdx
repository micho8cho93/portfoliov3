title: Variables, Expressions, and Statements
description: Learn how Python stores values, evaluates expressions, and reads user input.
order: 1
estimatedMinutes: 55
objectives:
  - Distinguish constants from variables and update values predictably.
  - Evaluate arithmetic expressions using operator precedence.
  - Convert user input into numeric data with `int()` and `float()`.
  - Write clear statements that combine input, processing, and output.
tryIts:
  - title: Track a running score
    prompt: Create and update variables that represent a player's score after a bonus round.
    starterCode: |
      score = 10
      print("Starting score:", score)

      bonus_points = 7
      score = score + bonus_points

      print("Updated score:", score)
    expectedOutput: |
      Starting score: 10
      Updated score: 17
    tags:
      - variables
      - assignment

  - title: Predict expression results
    prompt: Run the code and explain why each expression produces its value.
    starterCode: |
      a = 8 + 2 * 3
      b = (8 + 2) * 3
      c = 20 / 5 + 4

      print("a =", a)
      print("b =", b)
      print("c =", c)
    expectedOutput: |
      a = 14
      b = 30
      c = 8.0
    hints:
      - Multiplication and division happen before addition and subtraction.
      - Parentheses change the order of operations.

      - precedence

  - title: Convert input into numbers
    prompt: Ask the user for hours studied and print double that value as a number.
    starterCode: |
      hours = input("How many hours did you study? ")
      doubled = int(hours) * 2
      print("Double your study hours:", doubled)
    expectedOutput: |
      Example input: 6
      Double your study hours: 12

breakIts:
  - title: String + integer crash
    prompt: Run this code and identify why Python raises an error.
    starterCode: |
      age = input("Enter your age: ")
      next_year = age + 1
      print("Next year you will be", next_year)
    expectedOutput: |
      TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
    hints:
      - "`input()` always returns text."
      - Convert `age` before adding 1.
    tags:

      - typeerror

  - title: Case-sensitive variable names
    prompt: Run the code and explain what Python cannot find.
    starterCode: |
      total_score = 42
      print(Total_score)
    expectedOutput: |
      NameError: name 'Total_score' is not defined
    tags:
      - variables
      - debugging

fixIts:
  - title: Repair a checkout total
    prompt: Fix the code so it adds tax correctly and prints a numeric total.
    starterCode: |
      subtotal = input("Subtotal: ")
      tax_rate = 0.08
      total = subtotal + subtotal * tax_rate

      print("Total:", total)
    solutionCode: |
      subtotal = float(input("Subtotal: "))
      tax_rate = 0.08
      total = subtotal + subtotal * tax_rate

      print("Total:", round(total, 2))
    expectedOutput: |
      Example input: 50
      Total: 54.0
    hints:
      - "`subtotal` must be numeric before multiplication."
      - "`float()` is a good choice for prices."
    tags:
      - type-conversion
      - arithmetic

  - title: Fix precedence in a weighted score
    prompt: Repair the formula so quiz counts as 40% and project counts as 60%.
    starterCode: |
      quiz = 70
      project = 90

      weighted_score = quiz + project / 2
      print("Weighted score:", weighted_score)
    solutionCode: |
      quiz = 70
      project = 90

      weighted_score = quiz * 0.4 + project * 0.6
      print("Weighted score:", weighted_score)
    expectedOutput: |
      Weighted score: 82.0
    tags:
      - expressions
      - precedence

checks:
  - label: Explain input type
    type: concept
    criteria: Describe why `input()` returns a string and when `int()` or `float()` is needed.

This module focuses on how Python evaluates simple programs.

## Constants vs Variables

A variable points to a value that can change while your program runs.

A constant is a value you decide not to change on purpose (Python does not enforce constants, but naming conventions help).

```python
MAX_ATTEMPTS = 3
current_attempt = 1
```

Use clear names so each statement reads like a sentence.

## Expressions and Operator Precedence

An expression combines values and operators to produce a result.

Python evaluates operators in a standard order (for example, `*` before `+`) unless parentheses override it.

```python
print(8 + 2 * 3)      # 14
print((8 + 2) * 3)    # 30
```

## Type Conversion

`input()` returns text, even when the user types digits. Convert data before arithmetic:

```python
minutes = int(input("Minutes studied: "))
print(minutes + 10)
```

Use `int()` for whole numbers and `float()` for decimals.

## Using `input()` in a Full Statement Flow

A common beginner pattern is:

1. Read input
2. Convert type
3. Compute result
4. Print result

```python
name = input("Name: ")
score = float(input("Quiz score: "))
print(name, "earned", score)
```

Follow that pattern and debugging becomes much easier.
