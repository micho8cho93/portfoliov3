# What You Will Use in the Next Lesson

This briefing covers the file-handling toolkit for your second mission.

## Command Set

- `mkdir <dir>`: create a new directory.
- `touch <file>`: create an empty file or update file timestamp.
- `cp <src> <dest>`: copy a file or directory (`-r` for directories).
- `mv <src> <dest>`: move or rename files/directories.
- `rm <file>`: delete files (`-r` for directories, use carefully).
- `cat <file>`: print full file contents.
- `head <file>`: show first lines quickly.
- `tail <file>`: show last lines quickly.
- `less <file>`: scroll interactively through content.
- `nano <file.extension>`: edit text in the terminal.
- Save in nano: `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`.
- Exit nano: `Ctrl + X`.
- `vi <file>`: open file in vi for modal editing practice.
- `sed 's/old/new/g' <file>`: stream-edit text patterns.

## Why These Commands Matter

You will constantly create, rename, copy, and clean files in Linux workflows. Knowing when to preview with `head`/`tail`, inspect with `less`, and edit safely with `nano` prevents data loss and saves time.

## Challenge Preview

The next page is a **file recovery and cleanup mission** in the terminal emulator.

You will:

1. Rebuild a project directory tree.
2. Restore missing files from backups.
3. Fix text mistakes and verify changes.
4. Remove obsolete files without deleting good data.

## What This Teaches

- Safe file operation sequencing.
- Terminal-based text editing fundamentals.
- Basic data hygiene habits in Linux projects.
