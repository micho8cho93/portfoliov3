# Mission Brief

A teammate corrupted your project workspace. Important notes are scattered, renamed, or partially broken. Your task is to restore a clean deliverable folder.

## Challenge Type

This is a **structured restoration challenge**. You will create missing directories, copy data from backups, edit content, and remove junk files while preserving critical artifacts.

## Terminal Mission

<LinuxTerminal />

## Success Criteria

- Final directory matches the requested target layout.
- All required files contain corrected text.
- Unnecessary files are removed.
- You can explain where `nano`, `head`/`tail`, and `cp`/`mv` each helped.
