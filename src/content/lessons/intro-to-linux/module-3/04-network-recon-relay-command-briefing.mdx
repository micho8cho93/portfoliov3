# What You Will Use in the Next Lesson

This briefing introduces commands used for connectivity checks and remote interactions.

## Command Set

- `ping <host>`: tests basic reachability and latency.
- `traceroute <host>`: shows network path hops.
- `route`: displays kernel routing table.
- `ssh user@host`: opens a secure remote shell session.
- `curl <url>`: fetches web content or APIs from the terminal.
- `wget <url>`: downloads files over HTTP/HTTPS.

## Why These Commands Matter

When something “doesn’t work,” Linux users must determine if the issue is local, routing-related, remote-host-related, or application-level. These commands create that diagnostic chain.

## Challenge Preview

The next page is a **network triage relay** in the emulator.

You will:

1. Validate connectivity with `ping`.
2. Investigate path breaks with `traceroute` and `route`.
3. Pull remote instructions with `curl`/`wget`.
4. Simulate remote access decisions with `ssh` syntax.

## What This Teaches

- Practical troubleshooting flow for network incidents.
- Differences between connectivity checks and content retrieval.
- Foundational remote operations vocabulary.
