# Mission Brief

Your service-monitoring team reports intermittent outage warnings. You must investigate connectivity, identify where requests fail, and retrieve a remote status token.

## Challenge Type

This is a **network troubleshooting scenario** where each command output gives evidence for the next action.

## Terminal Mission

<LinuxTerminal />

## Success Criteria

- You provide a short diagnosis of the likely failure point.
- You retrieve the required token/content from a remote endpoint.
- You justify which command confirmed each conclusion.
