# What You Will Use in the Next Lesson

This final briefing combines system diagnostics with search and comparison commands.

## Command Set

- `top`: live process and CPU/memory activity view.
- `df -h`: disk usage by mounted filesystem.
- `du -sh <path>`: directory/file size summary.
- `free -h`: memory usage snapshot.
- `uname -a`: kernel and system info.
- `uptime`: system runtime and load averages.
- `who`, `whoami`, `w`: logged-in user context.
- `grep <pattern> <file>`: search matching lines.
- `find <path> -name '<pattern>'`: filesystem search by name.
- `locate <name>`: database-backed path lookup.
- `sort <file>`: order lines alphabetically/numerically.
- `diff <file1> <file2>`: show line-by-line differences.

## Why These Commands Matter

Real Linux tasks often combine “What is this machine doing?” with “Where is the data?” and “How are these files different?” This command set supports all three.

## Challenge Preview

The next page is a **forensics-style terminal gauntlet**.

You will:

1. Capture system health clues.
2. Identify user/session context.
3. Locate, filter, and compare files to uncover a final answer.

## What This Teaches

- Structured incident triage behavior.
- Fast information extraction from noisy outputs.
- Cross-checking evidence before making conclusions.
