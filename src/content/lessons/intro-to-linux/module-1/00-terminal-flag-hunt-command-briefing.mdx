# What You Will Use in the Next Lesson

Before the mission page, this briefing teaches the exact command set you need.

## Command Set

- `ls`: lists visible files and directories in the current location.
- `ls -a`: lists all entries, including hidden names that start with `.`.
- `cd <directory>`: changes your current directory.
- `cd ..`: moves one level up to the parent directory.
- `cat <file>`: prints file contents to the terminal.

## Why These Commands Matter

These commands train your most important Linux habit: **inspect first, move second, read third**. Instead of clicking around, you build a mental map of where you are and what is available.

## Challenge Preview

The next page is a **terminal flag hunt** inside the Linux terminal emulator.

You will:

1. List directory contents and discover hidden entries.
2. Move through nested folders using relative paths.
3. Open clue files and identify the final flag.

## What This Teaches

- Confidence with command-line movement.
- Awareness that hidden files often store important configuration or clues.
- A repeatable workflow for exploring unknown Linux environments.
