# Mission Brief

You are dropped into an unfamiliar directory tree. A hidden flag proves you can move through Linux paths with intention instead of guesswork.

## Challenge Type

This is a **guided navigation puzzle**. You will chain simple commands in the right order to reveal hidden files and recover the target value.

## Rules

1. Use only terminal commands in the emulator.
2. Do not refresh to skip steps.
3. Aim to use every required command at least once.

## Terminal Mission

<LinuxTerminal />

## Success Criteria

When you find the flag, explain:

- The exact command sequence you used.
- Where `ls -a` was essential.
- One mistake you made and how you corrected it.
