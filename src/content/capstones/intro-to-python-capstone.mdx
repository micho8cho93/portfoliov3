courseId: intro-to-python
title: Mini Student Gradebook CLI
description: Build a multi-file Python command-line app that collects grades, computes summaries, and prints student reports.
order: 1
estimatedHours: 4
prerequisites:
  - Variables and type conversion
  - Conditionals and loops
  - Functions
  - Strings and lists
milestones:
  - Plan the data model for students, assignments, and scores.
  - Implement input and validation flow for adding student records.

Use this capstone to combine all six modules into one practical program.

## Project Brief

Create a command-line gradebook where a teacher can:

- Add student names
- Enter multiple assignment scores
- Print averages and letter grades
- View a final class summary

## Technical Requirements

Use functions for each major action, loops for menus, conditionals for grading rules, and lists for storing score data.

## Suggested Structure

- `main.py` for menu flow
- `gradebook.py` for data logic
- `reporting.py` for summary output

Keep the first version simple, then iterate.
