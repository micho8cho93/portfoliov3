This course explains internet traffic like a delivery system, from the app layer all the way down to cables and radio waves.

## Course Overview

Each lesson focuses on one layer and uses the same learning flow:

1. A simple real-world analogy.
2. The exact components in that layer.
3. A looped visual showing what moves where.
4. Practice prompts and quick checks.

## Layers You Will Learn

1. Application layer: DNS, HTTP, TLS
2. Transport layer: TCP and UDP
3. Network layer: IP routing between networks
4. Data Link layer: frames and local delivery
5. Physical layer: fiber, copper, and wireless signals

## Why This Matters

When a page loads slowly or fails, these layers help you reason about where the problem might be: naming, request rules, delivery guarantees, routing, local switching, or physical medium.
