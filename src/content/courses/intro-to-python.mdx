This course keeps the same six-module sequence from your PowerPoint deck and adds consistent practice sections to each lesson.

## Course Overview

Each module contains short explanations, guided exercises, and debugging practice:

- `Try It`: Small coding reps to build fluency quickly.
- `Break It`: Intentional bugs so students can diagnose what failed.
- `Fix It`: Repair challenges with expected behavior and hidden solutions.

## Audience

This course is designed for learners who are new to programming and need structured, repeatable practice.

## Prerequisites

No prior programming course is required. Learners should be able to open a terminal and run Python files.

## How to Use Try / Break / Fix

Work through sections in order. For each `Fix It`, write your own repair before opening the solution disclosure.
