This course teaches Linux command-line fundamentals through a repeating format:

1. **Command Briefing** lesson pages that explain commands, syntax, and what to watch out for.
2. **Terminal Mission** lesson pages where you apply those commands in hands-on challenges.

## Course Overview

You will complete four increasingly difficult mission tracks:

1. **Terminal Flag Hunt** (navigation foundations)
2. **File Ops Rescue** (file creation, editing, and management)
3. **Network Recon Relay** (network diagnostics and remote basics)
4. **System Detective Gauntlet** (system analysis and information triage)
